# Data--Compression
<h1>Data-Compression <h1>
Data compression – I write this program using LZW coding and adaptive arithmetic decoding.
This program using LZW coding and adaptive arithmetic decoding.
The program is able to do follow procedures:
a)	to read input text file  "input.txt";
b)	to create binary file of compressed data "compressed.bin";
c)	to create file of compressed data "compressed.txt"; The file should be a text of '0' and '1' , i.e. text expression of the binary code;
d)	to read binary file of compressed data "compressed.bin" and decompress it to "output.txt";
e)	to decode the compressed data with the help of adaptive arithmetic coding

this program include :-

You have 10-letter alphabet: 0, 1, 2, …, 9. All probabilities of the letters are equal.
Take your I.D. number (ignore zero in the beginning) (Write your ID on input.txt file ) 
and  automatically created follow sentence: on file (inputMultID.txt) 
1*(I.D.) 2*(I.D) … 9*(I.D.)
For example, if I.D. number n = 3246266704
2*n = 6492533408; 3*n = 9738800112; … 9*n = 29216400336;
The sentence will be:
324626670464925334089738800112…29216400336
Repeat this sentence 1000 times. 

this repositories include:-

a) Initial sentence;
b) Encoded sentence (bits written as text);
c) Encoded sentence written in bits
d) Final dictionary
e) Resulting decoded sequence
f) Java Code
g) all the requirement files
